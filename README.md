# Front-end Developer Open Source Project Collection

This project aims to provide a curated list of open-source projects suitable for front-end developers at different skill levels - beginner, intermediate, and advanced.

## Project Overview

As a front-end developer, it's important to continuously work on personal projects and contribute to open-source initiatives to enhance your skills and build a strong portfolio. This collection of open-source projects covers a wide range of front-end topics, allowing developers to explore, practice, and showcase their talents.

The project is divided into three main sections:

1. **Beginner Projects**: These projects are suitable for front-end developers who are just starting out or have limited experience. They focus on teaching fundamental concepts and building simple, but functional, web applications.

2. **Intermediate Projects**: These projects are designed for front-end developers who have a solid understanding of front-end technologies and are looking to expand their skills. They cover more complex topics and encourage problem-solving and architectural decision-making.

3. **Advanced Projects**: These projects are intended for experienced front-end developers who want to challenge themselves and contribute to more sophisticated open-source initiatives. They involve working with modern front-end frameworks, libraries, and tools, and often require a deeper understanding of software development practices.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
front-end-developer-open-source-projects/
├── beginner/
│   ├── project-1/
│   ├── project-2/
│   └── ...
├── intermediate/

│   ├── project-2/
│   └── ...
└── advanced/
    ├── project-1/
    ├── project-2/
    └── ...
```

Each project directory contains a README file with detailed instructions on how to set up, run, and contribute to the project. Additionally, the project includes a main README file (this one) that provides an overview of the entire collection.

## How to Contribute
